# DFT-QE

Let's start exploring your materials' properties with ease and precision! Welcome to the DFT-QE WaNo, which performs DFT calculations using the powerful and flexible Quantum Espresso code! Quantum Espresso is an open-source software package that can handle many systems, from small molecules to extended solids. It provides a wide range of exchange-correlation functionals. It can be used to perform various types of calculations, including ground state properties, electronic structure, and phonon calculations. With our WaNo, the pseudopotentials ([SSSP Efficiency (version 1.1.2)](https://www.materialscloud.org/discover/sssp/table/efficiency)) are automatically identified based on the chemical species specification. All input files are generated or loaded automatically after reading the geometry file in ```.cif``` format, making it easy for you to start.
