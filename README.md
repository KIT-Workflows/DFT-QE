# DFT-QE

This WaNo performs the DFT calculation using Quantum Espresso code. The pseudopotentials ([SSSP Efficiency (version 1.1.2)](https://www.materialscloud.org/discover/sssp/table/efficiency)) are automatically identified based on the chemical species specification. Here all the input files might be automatically generated or loaded after reading the geometry file in ```.cif``` format.
